When Receiver starts the user has chance to enter IP address of the Sender, port number used by the
Sender to receive ACKs (3321 in the example above), port number used by the Receiver to receive data
(4455 in the example above), name for the file to store the data (for example, received.txt), and hit
the RECEIVE button.
Sender will open the file (test.txt in the example above) and send its content in the series of
datagrams, each containing piece of file data (no more than MDS bytes) and a sequence number (0 or 1).
Sender will also send special EOT (End Of Transmission) datagram (content of EOT datagram to be
defined by you). Receiver will acknowledge every received datagram and save the data extracted from
datagrams in a file (for example, received.txt), using sequence numbers for proper reconstruction
of the content of the file. File is delivered with no losses if it is an exact copy of the original file (so the
content of test.txt and recieved.txt is the same). At the end of transmission (when EOT is
acknowledged) the Sender will print the Total-Transmission-Time in seconds.
The reliable/unreliable mode of the Receiver is used to simulate packet losses: if the Receivers mode
is unreliable  the receiver will drop every 10 th packet without sending acknowledgement for it, and
without buffering the content of the packet. This will force the Sender to retransmit it after timeout.
Note, that ACKs sent by the Receiver do not require the simulation of losses. Also note, that losses can
happen even in reliable mode due to the nature of UDP protocol, but they are very unlikely, that is
why the simulation of losses is required
